I responded the other day for a 30 year old male who had fallen off of a ladder about 3 ft. The patient was CAOX4 and denied any LOC. Patient stated that he lost his footing and fell. His only complaints where his lower right arm which appeared to be broken and a 1 inch laceration on his fore head. I did a through assessment and found no numbness and tingling, no neck/back pain, palpation of the spine was normal and no pain upon ROM. I made the decision to defer spinal immobilization and transport in a postilion of comfort.
