Requesting orders to transport a 67 year old male. Dispatched on lift assist, got out here and he was face down in the kitchen with food on the stove. He has a laceration above his right eye, and several marks on his arms and torso can't tell if they are from this incident or not. Seems to be alert and oriented. Doesn't have a care taker available for the next 24 hours. Would like to get him brought in, believe he is a hazard to himself. He is refusing transport at this time. Requesting orders.
