Question: A script for a brief radio or telephone report that a medic would give to the medical control hospital or physician while on scene or enroute to the hospital. They should be complete with vital signs, treatment provided, etc. I will make any necessary changes to reflect our local system guidelines or learning points that I want to illustrate. It would be nice to have a some scripts where the medic has to ask medical control for orders and the resident has to figure out whether or not to give the order. I'll also cut out some information so the residents will learn to ask for certain vital information if not given with the original report. Crappy reports are also welcome, since the resident will have to try to make sense of perhaps incomplete or jumbled prearrival information. So can you help a brother out?
