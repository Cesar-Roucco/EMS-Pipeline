Doc, this is Medic 28. I have a 31 year old white male who was unrestrained driver of a four-door sedan, travelling at a high rate of speed. He lost control and collided sideways with a steel sign post, which ripped the car in half. The car is in two pieces, about thirty metres apart. Everything from the dashboard forward is in one half, and from the drivers seat back in the other. The patient was found ambulatory on the scene. He is alert and fully oriented. He is atraumatic to inspection and palpation. There are no signs of ETOH or other intoxication. Vitals: BP 144/90, Pulse 118, Respirations 16. He denies LOC, has no complaints of pain or injury, and is refusing care or transportation.
