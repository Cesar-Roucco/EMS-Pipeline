"Hi doc, this is CBEMT from _____________. Doc I have an 18 year old male with a history of seizures, he had a witnessed grand-mal seizure of approximately 30 seconds per the witnesses. He's still postictal at this time, kind of in and out in terms of lucidity, says he hasn't taken his seizure meds in two weeks. BP is 150/90, pulse 120, respirations about 28, and he weighs about 200 pounds. We have him on O2, IV is in. Doc if you don't mind, I'd like an order for Versed in case he starts seizing again."
