25 year old male with a carotid hemorrhage secondary to a knife wound. It cannot be controlled and he is profusely hemorrhaging. I said we need to go to the nearest hospital for immediate blood and some sort of emergency wound control. However, it would appear that the correct answer is to go to the trauma center further away. I forget his vitals but I think his BP was around 130/80.
