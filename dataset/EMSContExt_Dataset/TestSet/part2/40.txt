So you're working a BLS ambulance (dual EMT.....though if you happen to work 1+1 Medic/Basic or dual Medic I wouldn't mind hearing how that changes from the dual EMT in the scenario!). It's evening rush hour in a big city. You get dispatched to a reported motorcyclist down on the Freeway (think Los Angeles area freeway, 4 lanes jammed with rush hour traffic all inpatient to get home). As you pull onto the freeway at the entrance before the reported location, just as you're in the gore point just before the onramp actually meets freeway lane you see the crash off to your left almost immediately perpendicular to you....and there's a small curb in the gore point (and the curb ends passed the crash location). The crash is in the far left lane, and from where you are at you can see one person is down on the pavement underneath a pickup truck. There's at least one Police car parked on scene but down stream of the accident....you do have ALS fire department responding on initial dispatch but a) they are nowhere in sight yet, and b) due to the unexpected location it's actually in another department's jurisdiction
