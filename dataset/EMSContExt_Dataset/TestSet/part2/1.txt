you have a patient in the back and your partner is driving when your patient goes into cardiac arrest. You're still 10 minutes out from any hospital, what do you do? Obviously I know CPR needs to be started but since it's only you back there in a moving vehicle would you immediately just start chest compressions and do those continuously? Hook up the AED? Get out the BVM and get his airway prepared for breaths? I am just confused because there are a lot of things that need to be done in order to effectively give CPR and I feel like chest compressions are the most important but can you really afford to interrupt chest compressions to try and find all the other stuff (BVM, AED and pads) and get it all together on the patient?
