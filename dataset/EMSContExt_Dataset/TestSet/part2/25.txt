a call came in for an (appx) 80 y/o male patient to be taken to the ER due to altered mental status. The call came from a nursing home. Pt reported to have backhanded another resident and thrown a metal folding chair at a nurse. upon arrival the man was sitting down eating his lunch like nothing had happened. RN relays to us that he is demented. Pt gets on stretcher on his own and even begins to buckle himself in! during transport he and I have a normal conversation, he doesn't complain of any injury or illness, no difficulty breathing. All of his vitals are within normal ranges and he even answers questions appropriately. He is AXOX4. It was a short transport, only about 7 mins, and we're talking about christmas coming within the week, we arrive at the ER. I turn to the doors on the truck and its raining and really cold, my partner opens the doors and i tell the Pt "get ready mr.xxx it's pretty chilly out!" and i get no response i say his name again and give a sternum rub, no response. we take him inside and hand him over to ER staff. We had a call pending so all i could do was give a report and leave. Next day at ER again his nurse tells us he was intubated within 5 minutes of being there and died later that evening.
