Call comes in: 45 YO M PT found unconscious, unresponsive w/ no pulse in the middle of a mountain bike trail by another rider. The rider calls 911 and relays this info. You show up and have trouble locating the trailhead. Dispatch is advising of "fire roads" that cut through the middle of the trail. You are rushing to find access to the trail fearing the worst for the patient and knowing every passing second could be critical.

You find entrance to the trail and estimate the Pt to be 1.5-2.5 miles into the trail. It is not wide enough for a vehicle so your partner calls for the rescue ATV but it has an ETA of 15 minutes.

What do you do? Run the few miles with the jump bag? Forget the jump bag and just take the airway bag? What if you got lost and/or couldn't find the Pt and you become another obstacle and distraction for Pt care? Wait for ATV?
