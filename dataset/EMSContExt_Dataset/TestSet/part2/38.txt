Dispatched to "rollover with entrapment". You read your CAD notes and realize that it actually states that patient is trapped in between a vehicle and a building (in this case a double wide trailer). You arrive on scene to find a mid sized SUV sitting extremely close to said building. You see a patient on the ground in the supine position. She is alert and oriented X 4 and you immediately establish contact while your partner asks the patient's mother (who is freaking out) about the incident. Patient's mother states she found the patient (a 38 y/o female) wedged between the SUV and the double wide. The vehicle was in drive. Your patient states she was trying to stop the vehicle because she "left it in drive" when the vehicle pinned her pelvis and left arm against the house. She says that she was pinned for "2 minutes but it could have been longer".

On assessment you find the patient is CAO X 4 with a GCS of 15 her primary complaint is pain to the right hip and pain to the left arm. On inspection the left arm has significant swelling and is extremely tender halfway between the elbow and the wrist. She is tender on palpation of the right pelvis along the ischial border but no crepitus or instability is noted. The pelvis is so tender that palpation elicits a sustained grimace and patient relates it is a 7/10. CSM is intact in all extremities. Left arm is very tender and you highly suspect a fracture due to the swelling and amount of tenderness. Deformity is mild. The rest of the assessment reveals no other significant findings.
