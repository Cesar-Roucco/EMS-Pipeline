You are working on a dual paramedic truck when you are dispatched to a patient complaining of anxiety. You are about 15 miles out from the nearest hospital in a suburban/semi-rural part of your response area.

When you arrive on scene you are led inside a large, newer house to the living room where you find your patient, an approximately 35 year old man sitting on the couch appearing to be in moderate distress.
