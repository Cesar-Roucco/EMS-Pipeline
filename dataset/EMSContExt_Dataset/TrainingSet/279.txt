You are called to the residence of a 42 y/o male who is c/o sob. He was released from the hospital 5 days ago after having the lower and middle lobes of his right lung removed due to cancer. The surgery was 2 weeks ago and his postop course was relatively uneventful. He started feeling sob earlier in the day and has noted some bleed streaks in his sputum when he coughs tonight. What do you want to know
