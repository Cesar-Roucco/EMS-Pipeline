You are at a residence of a male patient c/o mild SOB. You have assessed him and figure he definitely needs to get seen sooner rather than later but not a huge huge kill us getting there rush (put him at a 3/5 in "sick scale"). You tell him you want to bring him in and then he lets you know that his two young children (both 5 and under) are in the house. He is a single parent and has no family in the town. This is a rural community and the regional police advise they are 60mins away.
