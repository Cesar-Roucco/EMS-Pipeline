You respond to a 4 story apartment complex with you partner for a sick call. The patient is on the 4th floor (of course). You walk into the lobby and see to your left a 'out of order' sign on the elevator. So you hump your way to the 4th floor to find your patient. It is a 400 lbs female patient who is pale and sweaty. Pulse 42, resperations 12, blood pressure 103/54 o2 sats 95. Chief complaint is weakness and nausea. Oh yeah her is the fun part she is very limited in mobility. So know the question is what do you do and what equipment do you usually take with you and what are you going to have to go back to the bus for.
