If you came upon a scene of an accident, lets say vehicle vs pedestrian, you've assesed the patient level of conciousness. AXO3. His airway is patent,free of fluid. Is breathing rate is 24,shallow and labored. So anyways aside from your assesments,how will you move this patient? orthopaedic scoop,then spine board? how will you roll this patient to assess if their are any other injuries? Traction splint is out of picture because your protocol says it is a "assist advanced provider only"
