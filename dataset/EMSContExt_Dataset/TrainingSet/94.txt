Called to the fair grounds where the Carnival crew is in town. Looking for a 28y/o who has been electrocuted.

There you find 20+ "Carnies" drinking and having a good time.

You ask for the patient, and a 6'4 340lb young man walkes over and introduces himself. He is in no obvious distress, however is holding his hands out in front of him as if they were soaking wet (if you get the picture).

He is slurring his speech slightly, and has ETOH on his breath.

He states that he was sittng on a step drinking rum & Coke, when he started to get tingling in his fingers, that has now turned into an "electric feeling" in both his arms from the elbow down.
