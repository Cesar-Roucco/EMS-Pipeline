You are called to the home of an elderly female by family who visits her often. They tell you she has a history of Alzheimer's, but they think she is getting worse and needs to go to ER to be evaluated. You ask why and they state she keeps constantly scrubbing at the bathroom floor several times a day stating it's not clean (they tell you it's spotless). And her behavior has just been a little off. She's been a bit out of it, last couple days.

Nearest ER is 45 minutes
