You are the only ambulance in a rural area of about 1500 square miles.

You get a call of a man who has fallen over 200 feet down a cliff and hill.

The scene is supposedly 4 miles into rough terrain and it's 11pm at night

There is one person who meets you where he called you which is a convenience store about 4 miles from the scene but this person does not remember how he got to the store due to alcohol being involved.
