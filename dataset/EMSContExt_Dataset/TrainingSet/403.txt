You are called to a restaurant for a possible stroke. You arrive to find a 32y/o male c/o tingling around his mouth and in his tounge. He didn't think anything of it at first but started getting concerned when his hands were going numb and he seemed to have trouble picking things up. For those that will ask, yes the scene is safe.
