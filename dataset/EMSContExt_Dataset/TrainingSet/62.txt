A sick person call.

You are dispatched to a nice suburban home for a 57 year-old male who coughed up blood and a piece of metal two days ago. His mother called an ambulance because she is worried because her son is looking gray.

You are greeted at the door by the concerned mother. My son has a soft trachea and he had surgery on it a month ago. He coughed out a piece of metal and has been getting sicker since it happened.

You enter the living room and see a thin, frail looking middle age man in a chair. He is coughing and spitting up copious amonts of thick yellow secreations. He looks up weakly and drops his head.
