You and your colleague are dispatched for an urgent transfer from your community hospital to a larger regional hospital.

Initially, this was coded as a routine transfer but it has been upgraded because the patient has become more unstable.

Mr. Smith is a 67 year-old male who was admitted with pneumonia three days ago. Over the last three days his condition has worsened.

On arrival to the medical unit you find an obese man in bed. The head of the bed is elevated to 45 degrees. The patient is pale, wheezing, and diaphoretic and wearing a NRB. He is connected to a telemetry pack. An RT wearing a protective gown and mask is at the bedside checking the patient’s SpOs. He tells you it is 85%.

You see a sign posted on the door that says ‘droplet isolation’.

The vital signs sheet is on a clipboard by the door and things do not look promising:

HR 120 irregular

BP 75/45

SpO2 85%

Temp 37.6

The nurse is on the phone talking with the receiving hospital sorting out where at the regional hospital the patient is to be admitted.
