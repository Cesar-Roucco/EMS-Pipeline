You are called to the residence of a 39 year old asthmatic at 3am, who is having respiratory distress that is unrelieved by her inhaler.  You hear moderate wheezing, but nothing to be concerned about, seems to be your average every day asthma call.  You get the patient to the truck and begin your first nebulizer treatment, and head to the hospital non-emergency (a 20 minute trip on backroads).  Your patient starts to get more "tired", and sats are not improving, so you go to the next level in your protocol (whatever that is), about 2-3 miles from the hospital the patient goes into respiratory arrest, you pull over and intubate the patient, reassess vital signs, all is stable, and sats are improving.  You know the closest engine company is a bout 5 miles away, and it is 3am, so you have to wait a little longer for them at this hour of the morning (in bed, got to throw on some turn-out gear, so you decide you will go to the ER instead of waiting on assistance from them.  Your partner drives lights and siren, and as he is turning on to the road the hospital is on, he makes a right hand turn in front of a car he thought had stopped, but it had not, and plows in to the side of your box.  Partner gets out, other driver is not injured (nor are anyone in the ambulance), it was low enough speed that the box is damaged but the truck is driveable, and you are literally 1/4-1/2 mile from the hospital. The patient's vitals are good except for respiratory rate, you do not believe the patient will go into cardiac arrest, but she is intubated.
