You get a call to go to a local preschool. The director meets you outfront and takes you into the downstairs kitchen for the school. You see your patient sitting in a stool drinking water looking like she's been hit by a mac truck. Her assissant is standing next to her. The assissant explains she's the one that called because the patient was not acting or thinking straight. It had gotten to the point she was scared and worried that "Karen's" sugar might be dangeriously high. She does know the patient has a history of diabeties but doesn't know any more than that.
