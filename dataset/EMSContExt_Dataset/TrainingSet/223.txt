We were sitting underneath a bridge at 820 and Marine Creek in Ft Worth where we normally post. All the sudden a SUV pulls up and the front seat passenger looks like he is having a SZ. I got out and began to do an initial assessment. The patient had agonal respirations, no radial pulses, but had a faint carotid pulse. As my partner approached the vehicle, I went to get our equipment. As soon as I got into the back I hear my partner yell "get a backboard he is in full arrest. So I grabbed the backboard and assisted my partner in getting the patient out of the vehicle. As soon as he was on the backboard, I began CPR. We had a Trainee on the truck, so I had him BVM the patient as I'm pumping chest. We then got the pads on him, to find the patient in coarse Vfib. We delivered 1 shock to the patient which converted the patient into Sinus Tach. My partner then tried for a line, which was unsuccessful. Then he went for the tube. As soon as he was about to intubate, the patient comes to and says "what the hell is going on?" We get him loaded up inside the ambulance. My partner makes a second attempt at a line, then pushes .5 of lidocaine and we transported code 3 to the hospital. The entire time we were transporting, the patient was slightly confused as to what was going on, but answering questions appropriately. Patient was dropped off at the hospital AOx4 and unremarkable. Only thing I wish we did is get a 12-lead, we only did 3-lead don't ask me why, that was my partner's call. I personally would have. As we left I got to shake the man's hand that only a few minutes prior I was pumping on his chest.
