You are a rural EMS service called to "steven king's rest home" which houses both the elderly and mentally challenged together for a sick person. Upon arrival, you enter the abadoned looking facility searching for a nurse to get a room number of where you need to go in the four story facility. You cannot find a nurse to get any information, so you start going from room to room when you hear a large thud from the floor above. You go upstairs to investigate (still trying to find a nurse) when you see a door dislodged from it's hinges. Upon opening the door, you find a rather large female (approx 400lbs) on the ground, naked, covered in vomit and urine and cyanotic. She is completely unresponsive and you begin care for this patient - what would you like to know or do? You are the only truck available with over an hour to the closest hospital. Your truck is a basic/medic configuration.
