Tones go off we get a call for a cardiac arrest, arrived on scene to be greeted by a person saying his uncle passed away, he drank himself to death. As we are pulling out the gurney He said we won't be needing that, but we grabbed it anyway. We walked inside to find our pt, supine and pale. I assessed for a pulse no pulse, no breathing. I checked for rigor, there is no rigor. The pt brother arrives on scene and says I don't want anything done for him, Your not going to take him and do cpr. So My partner talks to him. The pt has no dnr and the brother doesn't have power of attorney. I put the monitor on and its asystole in all three leads. The pt is warm to the touch. My partner and I roll the pt to check for lividity, there is a tiny tiny amount starting between his shoulder blades, and some minor mottleing, on his leg that was hanging off his bed. His brother insists that we don't do cpr and we are not to take him. We made contact with a MD just to confirm what we are doing and get in on record. I really can't think of anything else we could of done.
