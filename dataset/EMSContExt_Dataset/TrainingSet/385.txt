Nine year old female involved in an ATV accident. She was the driver, had on a helmet. Apparently hit a ditch, threw her off, landed on elbow. Enough force to cause major damage to elbow (later taken to higher treatment facility for pins in elbow).

Board or not?

Interested to see what some of you think. Yes, elbow was only injury. Family got her up walking around.

Some questions were raised between ems providers and nurse at ER.
