85 y/o female patient, Chest Pain with SOB.

Initial Contact:

BLS (PCP crew so think EMT-I) arrived first to patient with declining LOC, Bradycardia, SOB, Pale, diaphoretic. Patient arrested in BLS presence with CPR, PPV, AED applied immediately (one non-shockable rhythm analyzed prior to our arrival).

We arrived to BLS crew working the arrest 4 minutes into the resuscitation. The patient patient was found to be in an asystole with absent pulses. The kicker (pun intended) is that the patient was also combative with good CPR (kicking, pulling at the BVM, I'm talking a 2-2-5 total of 9 GCS).
