You respond to a 52-y/o male who got mildly short of breath after going for a jog.

You hook him up to the monitor and he is in a wide-complex tachycardia at a rate of 310.

He is no pale and diaphoretic, but he is fully alert and oriented and has a stable BP. No significant history except asthma.

Besides basic treatments like O2, positioning, IV, etc., what advanced treatments do you provide?
