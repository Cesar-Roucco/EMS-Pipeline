You see a boy who was happily playing basketball, when suddnely he goes to the wall, looks weak. He is your little cousin You go over to him and find that he has a weak pulse, and he is shaking and dizzy. He forgot about his blood glucometer..but he did bring along a tube of oral glucose and glucacon kit. You say, "let me give you some glucose"...he yells at you and says "go away! I dont need you!"....He passes out shortly after, and you cannot arouse him. 911 is called as soon as he passes out.

Treatment...check ABCs, lay the PT on his side and administer glucagon in the thigh 1mg (1cc).

You take a set of vitals: BP is 98/72 HR: 112 bpm and his breathing is fairly unremarkable at a rate of 17 per minute.

Response to this treatment: He wakes up right around when the Paramedic truck/ BLS Ambulance arrives.

You are cleared to go by the responding crews, and no more info is obtainable.

Reasoning: The glucose was originally indicated because of the known history, shaking, weak pulse, and dizziness..however the patient went unresponsive before it could be administered.

The glucagon was then indicated because he became unresponsive. Considering it was not syncope (as he did not wake up shortly after on his own) I feel that glucagon was indicated

My aunt taught me about the administration of glucagon, because her child is a diabetic, and she wanted more people to know what to do in case she wasnt around to help her child. (it is not contained in my First Responder course, only Oral Glucose is) Would this be acceptable to ambulance crews?
