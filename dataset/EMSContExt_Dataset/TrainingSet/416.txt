You find a 60y/o female in the house with a dog that as big as cow and a dovermen pincker, and is helped to the back porch by the pt, before she opens the door. Pt intially says that she has been stressed since her husband had open heart surgery triple bypass, just 2 weeks ago, and her 40 y/o son moved back in and she just can't handle the stress. Ok, what would you like to know other than her V/S are stable, W/P/D.
