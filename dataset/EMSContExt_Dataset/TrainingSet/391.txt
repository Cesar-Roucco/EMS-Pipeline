Called to a school code four (lights and sirens) tiered response with fire right ahead of you. You get the call as a five y/o male SOB.

Arrive scene-elementary school, pt is in the library with several teachers present. You see a child in no obvious distress, standing, fire department surrounding and talking to him, he appears to be looking away form you.
