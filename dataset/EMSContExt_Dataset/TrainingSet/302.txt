Call to report of possible OD. Arriving at the scene, 16yr. old male laying in the street with several family members on top of him, trying to restrain him. Very familiar with the family,(OD's, assaults, stabbings, shootings, etc.) Family members yelling, "He took a bunch of valium!", over and over again. Patient big for his age, 6'0", 100 K's. I'm not exagerrating when saying he was digging his finger nails into the asphalt. According to other family members just prior to his "fit" he was threatening suicide. Police and fire on the scene took over attempting to restrain him. He was continuously screaming, but unintelligible. The usual kicking. Placed in handcuffs. and placed face first onto stretcher. Still unknown substance abused, but definitely not valium. Unable to obtain vitals.
