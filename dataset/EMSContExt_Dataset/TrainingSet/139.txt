You arrive to find an infant (lets say 6 months old) that is cyanotic, sats in the 70s, all other vital signs normal for age (a little bit tachy). The mom says the patient was diagnosed with plastic left heart and was discharged from the children's hospital after having the first stage / procedure, "A Norwood" performed a few weeks ago.

You check out the home health folder and find that the patient has "Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome"
