I was disp to our local hospital for a emergent transfer to a larger hospital 27-30 miles away. Upon arrival you find a 80 y/o m pt in RM 3 that is intubated and has fluid running at 250 cc/hr, by orders of Dr, however, just before we transfer the pt to our cot the the nurse says that the last bp was 101/50, but just as we get ready to move the pt to the cot, the monitor shows a new bp of 75/30, and the nurse says as she increased the drip to W/O, that the pt has been running in the 80's and that she has been increasing the drip back and forth. To the that response the RT says I have had to suction fluid out of his tube 3-4 times. The orders for the trip are 250cc/hr, and 50% O2, per Dr in the ER. Enroute I suctioned the pt 2-3 times and bagged the pt with the pt breating against the BVM, and no one to help with the BP's but was still able to achieve, BP's hovered around 78-80's and the ER has said he was septic. I know what I did and I want on the info I told how you would have handled this run and remember the ER Doc hates EMS, and has expressed that we as useful as tits on a boar.
