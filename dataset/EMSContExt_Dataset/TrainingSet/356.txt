You respond to an Motor Vehicle Accident involving 2 people. You are a BLS unit. The first woman is fine, and refuses medical attention. The other person, a male in his mid 50's, is walking around, confused. You ask him to come with you in to the ambulance, and he's not really following directions. You finally get him in to the ambulance and he sits down.
