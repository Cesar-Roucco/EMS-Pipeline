Got dispatched to call for 39 yr old male with "headache" Upon arrival as assessment- no other complaints or findings.

Pt. stated pain scale 8 out of 10... My partner suggestion full neuro exem... Outside of checking things like facial droop and also weakness to one side or the other- what else can I look for to rule out CVA?
