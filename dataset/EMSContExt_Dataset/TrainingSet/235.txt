On a run last night, our squad was dispatched to the residence of male heart patient, who was unable to get up. Upon arrival found patient lying on floor. Family advised that they were assisting patient back to bed, and he became weak, and was lowered to the floor. Patient is under Hospice care due to severe 25% cardiac output. Patient is lethargic, with vitals as follows. P 168, BP 104/68, R 20. A-patent, B-spontaneous and non-labored, C-normal, warm and dry. Monitor shows a narrow tachycardia, with no visible "P" waves. Patient's family refuses patient to be transported d/t the fact if the patient is transported they would lose their Hospice care. Family advised that they have been instructed that they must call Hospice to determine if they should call 911, and if they do and have him transported, they will lose Hospice care.
