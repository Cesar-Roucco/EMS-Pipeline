You are called to the lake to meet a patient coming in on a boat who is having difficulty breathing. When you arrive, the boat has just docked and friends are removing the patient from the boat. When you do your history, you find that this 30-year-old female was scuba diving in 65 feet of water when her tank malfunctioned. She was forced to hold her breath and surface rapidly. Currently, she is having difficulty breathing, her skin is wet and "ashen" in appearance. Her blood pressure is 90/60, her respirations are 30, and her pulse is 120 with an oxygen saturation of 82%. Her lung sounds are clear on the right and almost completely absent on the left.
