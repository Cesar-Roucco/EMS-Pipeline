You are called to "weakness" at 3am. You find a healthy looking 30 year old male lying in bed, who claims his legs arent working right. He just feels weak all over. He denies any trauma to his body, no recent illness or fever, no headache or CVA symptoms. He has no previous history other than starting a new exercise routine in the past few weeks. His B/P is 130/80 supine, pulse is rapid at 130-150 (a little fast to count at 3am). His primary and secondary BLS survey are normal. D-Stick is normal. You ask him to sit up for an orthostatic b/p, and you note that he drags his legs off of the bed with his arms, and the legs flop to the floor like that of a paralyzed pt. Now realizing this may be more than the flu -- you question again about trauma, falls, exposure to anyone sick, anything you can think of --- you get nothing. He has sensation in his feet, legs, and rest of body, but just cant move his legs. He doesnt have a fever, no rash, you cant find anything unusual. So you backboard him and move him to the truck --- you decide to put him on the monitor to verify that heart rate --- and i be dadgummed, you are looking at Vtach in lead II (this was before twelve leads and pulse oxs). You check his b/p --still 130/80, A&OX3, no pain. You check lead 1, still Vtach -- you check lead III, which shows SVT - but the other two leads are still textbook Vtach.
