You respond to a medical office building for a female patient who is combative/emotional. Upon arrival with PD you find a 27YOF in an OBGYN office in the corner of an exam room visibly upset. Doctor reports she did not receive bad news today or anything that could explain what happened. Doctor was going to perform the pelvic when the female patient "freaked out" and would not let anyone touch her. Staff there tried to calm her down but she appears to be in a state and unable to communicate. (OBGYN is a male and has been her physician for 9 years).
