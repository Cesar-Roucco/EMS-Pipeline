It is midnight when you and your paramedic partner are dispatched to a patient complaining of shortness of breath. The patient is coming from a local rehab facility, fourth floor. You find your patient, a 70 year old obese female lying supine on their bed with very labored respirations audible from outside the room. The patient is staring straight up at the ceiling and does not respond to your presence. From the door you can see that they are very pale with cyanosis around the lips. Staff mysteriously disappears after directing you to the room, thankfully someone has left the paperwork on the counter.
