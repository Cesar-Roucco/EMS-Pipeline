You are dispatched to a suburban home for a 47 year-old female found unresponsive by her husband.

The scene is safe and you are greeted by the patient's husband. He tells you that he has been out of town for the last 48 hours for work. When he came home today he found his wife laying on the bedroom floor.

When you enter the bedroom you hear gurgling respriations and the patient appears pale and gray.
