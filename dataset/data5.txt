Field impression at the end

I have copied a fairly recent PCR that I did with some of the data removed or changed for obvious reasons:

D: Dispatched to the scene of a 76 year old male or female with weakness

C: 84 y/o male or female found sitting in chair at home with family at his/her side, pt reports “I think I feel alright,” family reports he/she has been very weak and breathing fast and they cannot get him/her out of his/her chair to get into the car to take him/her to the hospital, Pt contact made at 09:50

PmHx: HTN, BPH, Fall resulting in intracranial haemorrhage in December 2012

L: Last HS

E: Family reports that the patient has recently been discharged from rehab following a fall resulting in a TBI but has been progressively weak and unable to perform ADS’s with s/s that have worsened over the past couple of days

O: Last HS

P: Denies pain or discomfort

Q: Denies pain or discomfort

R: Denies pain or discomfort

S: Denies pain or discomfort

T: As defined above

A: HEENT: Sitting upright in chair, AO times 4 with movement in all extremities, atraumatic to exam, airway patent and self maintained with increased respiratory rate, pupils pinpoint and minimally reactive bilaterally, neck midline with flat jugular veins, Pt able to swallow without difficulty and smile w/o indication of facial droop, speech slow but non-slurred

Cx: Atraumatic, unlaboured respirations, no accessory muscle use, clear lung sounds in all lobes, no c/o dyspnoea, no overt s/s of respiratory distress, but rapid and deep respirations at a rate of 24 noted with regular rhythm, irregular, faint heart tones noted at an elevated rate of 112-118, firm, round mass with a diameter of approximately 5 cm noted to lower right anterior chest wall, Pt reports “I have had that forever”

Abd: Soft all quadrants, non tender to palpate, atraumatic to exam

Pelvis/GU: Pelvis stable and intact, full GU exam deferred, Pt reports that he/she has been having “difficulty going pee”

Ext: Movement in all extremities with weak bilateral hand-grips, atraumatic to exam, pale/cool/dry skin with decreased turgor, no indications of cyanosis or jaundice noted

Neck/Back: Atraumatic, midline w/o step offs, Pt denies any c/o

V/S: B/P- 60/40, P-118 & irregular, RR- 24 w/o overt indications of significant respiratory distress, SpO2-88% R/A, T-98 F, Wt~68 kg, Temp 97.1 F tympanic

Rx: 1) Pt contact and full assessment, placed on portable pulse oximeter and BGL of 265 mg/dl noted, Pt placed on supplemental Oxygen at 2 L/min via nasal cannula @ 09:50

2) Pt carried out of his/her room and down a small hallway via transfer sheet and placed onto the EMS str into semi Fowlers position by EMS crew, Pt reports “feeling like I’m going to faint” upon being picked up, Pt properly secured onto EMS str w/o incident @ 09:55

3) Loaded and properly secured in EMS unit for transport w/o incident, Placed on monitor for continuous SPO2 monitoring and cardiac monitoring in lead II with q 5 min v/s reassessments and XII lead acquisition and transmission to General Hospital ER w/o incident, sinus tachycardia with frequent unifocal PVC’s w/o overt ST changes or indications of BBB noted @ 10:00

4) 20 ga IV placed to L AC times one attempt using aseptic technique w/o incident along with BGL check (123 mg/dl), fluids up at 1,000 ml 0.9% NS at wide open rate for volume expansion @ 10:02

5) Radio report called to General Hospital ER w/o incident @ 10:05

6) Discussed possibility of Zofran administration for c/o nausea with EMS preceptor; however, she/he does not want to administer it at this time d/t "short ETA to the hospital", Repeat VS reassessment @ 10:10: B/P- 72/40, RR-22-24 and non-laboured, SPO2-96% 2 L NC, P-112 irregular, lung sounds remain clear after 500 ml of fluids have been administered, 1,000 ml challenge continued

T: Pt transported to General Hospital ER w/o incident or change in assessment or condition, bedside report and turnover to Dr Smith w/o incident @ 10:15

DDx:

1) Hypotension with possible tissue hypoperfusion

a) Possible infectious pathology (Consider urinary and respiratory sources as high priority systems to assess)

B) Possible toxicological etiology (Consider opiate toxicity with possible poly-pharmacy as a primary candidate)

2) Cannot rule out neurological event (TIA vs Stroke with possible increased ICP or intracranial mass effect)

3) Possible fluid volume deficit

4) Hypoxaemia with possible tissue hypoxia

5) Hypoglycaemia R/O with point of care BGL testing
