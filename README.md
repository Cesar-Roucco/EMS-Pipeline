For the demo, make sure all the required Python packages, PyQt4, MetaMap, and PyMetaMap are installed. MetaMap should be installed under the public_mm directory. To run MetaMap, first make the metamap.sh file executable by

`chmod +x metamap.sh`

Then run it by

`./metamap.sh`

Then run the GUI:

`Python gui.py`

You also need to have your Google Speech API key in a JSON file named service-account.json in the demo folder.
