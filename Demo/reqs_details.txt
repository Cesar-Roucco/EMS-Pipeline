requirements; this is how I set up the last version of the pipeline, both the packages and the tools I used to install them. It may not be comprehensive. I needed both conda and pip to install everything, and the packages below are divided into groups by whether I used conda or pip to install them. All the conda commands are run with "conda install" followed by the line accompanying the package (e.g. "conda install -c pyqt=4"). All the pip commands are run with "pip install" plus the line (e.g. "pip install py-trees==0.6.5"). The third section is something that must be done within the code.
