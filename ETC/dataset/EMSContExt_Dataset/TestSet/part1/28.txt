Hey here in QLD we ring the hospital via phone as opposed to radio (well in metro areas anyway).

Here's an example of what we may give:

363: Caboolture ED this is Fred from QAS Bravo 363 bringing in a pt

ED: Go ahead 363

363: have a 40YOM GCS 15 who has thrown fuel on a fire. Partial thickness burns to approx. 18% on his upper R thigh, stomach, groin and genital area. No known allergies, nil meds, nil medical hx. HR: 120, BP 130/85,IV access gained 10mg Morphine IV given so far and 3ml methoxyflurane. Pt covered with burn aid and cling wrap. Our protocol limits us to a total of 20mg morphine. ETA 20 minutes. Are you willing to give permission for additional pain relief if required?

On this job the Dr gave us permission to give up to a total of 30mg of morphine (so 10mg above our protocol) if required (which it wasn't).
