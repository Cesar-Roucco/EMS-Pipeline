Hi Doc this is Alex Kroeze, ACP, OASIS #15411

I'm 20 minutes from the closest ER. I'm calling for orders for a lidocaine bolus for ventricular bigeminy/trigeminy. Patient is a 75 y/o male with a history of COPD, Angina and Hypertension and is on salbutamol puffers, flovent puffers, nitro patch and metoprolol. Patient this evening while sitting watching TV had a sudden onset of inability to catch his breath as he describes it that doesn't feel like his usual respiratory difficulty. Patient took his own puffers with no relief and when it didn't go away within a few hours he called us. On arrival patient was ambulatory to meet us at the truck. On assessment he is in moderate respiratory distress and pale in colour. BP 102/68, P 68 and weak, R 20, SPO2 98% on NRB. He is in a sinus rhythm with periods of ventricular bigeminy that alternates with ventricular trigeminy. 12 Lead is non-diagnostic. Patient has no allergies. I'd like to give this patient a 1.5mg/kg bolus followed up by 0.75mg/kg q5min prn x2
