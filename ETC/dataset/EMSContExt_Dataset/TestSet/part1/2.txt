I recently had a patient in anaphylactic shock, I canâ€™t remember all of the vitals, but she was poorly perfused, tachy, BP 65/50, decreased conscious state, mottled skin, urticarial, GIT upset, but no broncho spasm. She received IM adrenaline, 02, fluids, supine legs elevated, etc. Upon reassessment somewhere after the five minute mark, she still remained hypotensive and had a marginal increase in heart rate, though no ectopics. She got a second dose of IM adrenaline and dexamethasone. After this, she became increasingly tachy and began having multiple PVCs, developed a bit of a tremor, though still was hypotensive. All in all, it took a good 25 minutes and close to a 1000mls of pressure infused saline to get her stabilized....minus the tremor and anxiety
