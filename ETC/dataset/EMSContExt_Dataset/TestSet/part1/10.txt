You are called to the local nursing home for a pt that is unresponsive. Upon your arrival the nurse tells you that half an hour ago the pt was fine. She was given her normal dose of methadone for her chronic pain. 30 minutes later they find her unresponsive with snoring respirations. On your exam she has b/l constricted pupils, stable airway but sats in the mid 80s, RR 8. You have IV access, blood sugar is 123. She is not responsive but withdraws when you poke her with the IV and do the finger stick. You decide this is due to the effect of narcotics
