I went to a call for a 60y/o choking (didn't know he was choking), and I couldn't feel a pulse.

No carotid

No radial

No nothing.

I looked at him when I entered the room, and was thought "yup.... he's dead" then confirmed it when I couldn't find a pulse.

I moved his arm off his chest as to start compressions, and noticed it was rigid. Then the unthinkable happened.... he put his arm back to his chest!

I redirected my focus and started bagging his stoma, and my partner snapped on an Sp02 monitor to find a waveform and a readout. couple breaths in he started getting some colour back and somewhere over the next while we pulled out an obstruction.

Full recovery

No CPR
