You are called for a 55 year old male for chest pain & shortness of breath. On arrival you find him seated in a recliner rubbing his chest. You notice that he is diaphoretic & pale. He tells you that he was working in the yard & developed chest pain & shortness of breath so he stopped to rest & when he told his wife who is an nurse, she gave him some Aspirin & called 911. Upon exam you note the following. His BP is 85/50, P is 120, RR is 22, Spo2 is 93% & his temp is 98.7. When you perform the 12 lead EKG you notice that he has T wave inversion in V1-V4. (Sorry I don't have a copy of the 12 lead, this is a patient I encountered after the first 911 call.) He was placed on 2 LPM via nasal cannula, an IV of normal saline was started & labs were drawn. The patients exam went as follows: 1. HEENT were WNL. 2. Lungs were slightly diminished with some wheezing noted. 3. Abdomen was soft, non tender. 4. CMS x4, 5. slight pedal edema was noted. PMHX included: Acid Reflux, Reactive Airway Disease & Hypertension. Allegies included: Benadryl, Omnicef & Morphine. Medications included: Albuterol Inhaler PRN, Zantac 150 mg BID & Vasotec 5mg. The patient was given a 250 ML bolus of normal saline for his blood pressure & he was transported to the ED. The small critical access hospital evaluated him & determined that he was suffering an MI. They started cardiac protocol & arranged for transport to an ICU 60 miles away. He was admitted to the ICU by Cardiology for treatment for 24 hours, then to the floor for an additional two days. He was started on 325mg Aspirin, Atenolol 25mg QD, Nitro Patch 0.1mg QD, Combivent Inhaler QID, Nexium 40mg QD & Simvastatin 10mg QD. He was sent home, shortly after arriving home he went to get up from his recliner & collapsed, his wife immediately called 911 & started CPR, he was coded for 1 hour, but failed to respond to any interventions. Cause of death Large PE.
