This is 511, Karen and Tim inbound to you with a 22 year old female complaining of severe left lower quadrant pain and vomiting. Patient states she believes she is 4 weeks pregnant. Patient presents diaphoretic and in obvious distress. Current vital signs, BP 88/40, HR 126 sinus tach on the monitor, RR 22, SPO2 100% on high-flow oxygen. I have two IV’s established, one saline lock, one on blood tubing and am currently administering a 250 ml bolus. I have administered Zofran 4 mg IVP. I’d like to administer fentanyl 50 to 250 mcg titrated to effect for pain control with your order. We have an ETA of approximately 20 minutes and will re-consult pending any changes or when closer in.
