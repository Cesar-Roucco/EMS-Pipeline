You respond to a residence for an allergic reaction. The FD is not on scene yet, and you're met by a very angry woman who said you took too long. 

She takes you inside where you find a mid 30s female laying on the bathroom floor near the toilet. There is liquid vomit on the floor and she is clinging to the toilet bowl. She is wearing workout clothes and appears sweaty. She states she administered an EpiPen in her thigh. She states her only history is an allergy to exercise. 

She states she was out running when she felt ill. This has happened before but she powered through it. When she got home she used her epi pen. 

Her last meal was about 1-2 hours ago. She has no other medical history and takes no medications on a regular basis. 

Vitals are all within normal limits, with the exception of being slightly tachycardic at 110bpm.
