Dispatched for 69 y/o F in a nursing home. Only helpful notes say poss stroke, unconscious and that she is breathing. 

Arrive on scene to find pt supine in bed. Eyes partially open, but pt not responsive to any stimuli during initial assessment. Airway patent, breathing a bit shallow rate approx. 14, pulses strong and rapid. 

Once on the monitor...pulse 140 sinus tach, bp 171/108, 88% room air trended down to 82% quickly, BGL 163. Around now the pt begins to have small tremors in her face, right hand, right foot.

After initial assessment staff bring sheet with Hx that includes dementia, seizures, and CVA. They say she is usually alert, ambulatory, and able to talk with staff. (There was a med list, I will go on and say I've forgotten what they were since I only skimmed it very quickly during the 4 minute drive). Last known well time given by staff was 1230 (its about 1650 now).
