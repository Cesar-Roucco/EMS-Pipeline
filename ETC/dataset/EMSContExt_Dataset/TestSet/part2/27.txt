You get dispatched to a location with a 23 year old male/female patient (your choice), and they are in police custody and is deemed a threat to themselves. Supposedly a behavioral call.
Once you are on scene, you perform the safety measure, SS, BSI, PPE, etc.
The patient willingly gets into the Ambulance and put up no fight. You do a contraband check with law enforcement and is deemed safe.
Then it is time for vitals, you notice that they are constantly looking around the vehicle and is tapping their foot. You ask them how they are feeling, trying to asses their level of consciousness.
All of a sudden they are unbuckling the safety restraints ("seat belts") on the cot, you are trying to persuade them to stop while asking your partner to pull over.
They become violent with you and make their way up to the front cabin and have taken control of the vehicle.
