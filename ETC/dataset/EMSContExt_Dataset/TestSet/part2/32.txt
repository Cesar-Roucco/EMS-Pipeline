We were called to one of our convalescent facilities in our area for a sick person. Get on scene to find an elderly person in their bed who had a severe GI Bleed and had bled over half his bed and it was even all over the floor. Fire had told us that the patient was throwing up blood as well. His vitals were normal however, his skin signs were pale and diaphoretic. Fire cancelled the squad on scene and had us go bls to the patients facility he was normally seen at rather than the closest. Both my partner and I thought that this for sure would be a follow up to the hospital because of how much blood loss the person had. 
After the call, my partner and I were a little uneasy about how the call went. I would have thought at least that the medics could have started an IV since the patient was dehydrated.
