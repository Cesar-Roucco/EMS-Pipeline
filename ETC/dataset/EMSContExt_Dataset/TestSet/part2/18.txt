I'm an EMT-B from California. I'm on a BLS crew, and today we were dispatched to a call for right sided leg, arm, and neck pain at a local SNF. 

Arrive on scene to find a 54 y/o female PT, A/O x 4, GCS 15. C/C is 10/10 pain in the right lower extremity radiating from her foot up to her lower back. She stated that it feels like something is moving up and down her leg, all the way down to her feet. She has abnormal sensation in the right foot, pedal pulses are strong, normal, and equal bilaterally. Her right leg seems to be very stiff, and she says that she can't move it. She can barely wiggle her toes in the right foot. 

She has right sided weakness when testing her grip strength, and apparent right sided facial droop. She has a Hx of TIA, and Diabetes type 2. We asked for a blood sugar from the facility, and we got 421. They said she had just eaten, and the last blood sugar of 176 was taken around 1200. We were on scene at approx. 1430. 

Her vitals were ... 
120/68

We called our dispatch and requested an ALS crew to come out for a possible stroke. The medic and his partner showed up, asked us what was going on, and went in to start their assessment. 

The medic starts his stroke assessment, and finds that there is right sided weakness but left sided arm drift. He asks her to shrug her shoulders, and raise her eyebrows. The PT tells him that she has a plate in her chin, and that's the reason her, "mouth is crooked". The medic then proceeds to say, "I'm not thinking stroke, I'm gonna call this generalized body pain." He tells us that because the arm drift is left sided and not right sided, he's ruling out stroke because it's, "the opposite side of the brain." Also, I overheard the medic say that she had, "sinus tach" as a rhythm

I'd like to clarify, I'm posting this situation in order to receive some feed back, and learn from this. I didn't have a chance to talk to the medic much before they took off, and I want to understand more about the ALS crew's thought process. The hospital they transported to isn't a stroke center, which tells me that the medic was certain of his assessment and ruling out of a stroke. 

I know there are correlations between hyperglycemia and stroke, and I will admit I don't understand much about the relationship between the two yet, as I've only started researching it today after leaving the call. I would have figured that with a Hx of TIA, displaying what I considered to be stroke like symptoms, that they would have atleast transported to a hospital with stroke capabilities, just to be on the safe side. 

For reference, the closest ER was about 3 minutes away, and the closest ER with stroke capabilities was about 15 minutes away. 

To be honest, the ALS crew look displeased to take over patient care, and I'm sure they thought we could have handled the call seeing as how we were right around the corner from the ER. 

We get these calls like this quite often, coming out of a SNF, calling it, "General weakness" or "Altered mental status". I want to know exactly what to look for, and how to identify a potential stroke before upgrading to ALS, for future reference, since I'm sure it will happen again. I'm a fairly new EMT-B, and don't have much experience at all on the ALS side.
