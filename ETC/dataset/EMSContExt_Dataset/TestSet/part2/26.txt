you are dispatched to a 41y M pt and on arrival of a fairly clean appearing home you find the pt just past the front door, sitting on the floor half in the jacket/shoe closet. He is clearly pale cool and diaphoretic. He is a/o x4 and complains of chest and side pain. The pt sts that 4 days ago he got home from surgery where half of one of his kidneys was removed. As to why his best explanation is that it was damaged. Initial vitals are P-102 irregular, R-38 and shallow, SPO2- 91%RA, BP-90/48 BGL-112.. Feel free to ask for any additional info and of course here is your first 12 lead..
