You are dispatched to a fall-not alert (priority 1 response). Upon arrival you find an 80 year old male slumped over by their bedside almost like they are praying with their back to you. Immediately you notice that the patient is not responding to verbal stimulus, and barely responds to a deep painful stimulus.

Because of the potential for a high-acuity patient you have your partner, and fire personnel place this patient on a mover and expedite movement from the house to your gurney for a more thorough assessment. While they're loading you begin to ask some questions to the patient's immediate family. They state that they had last saw the patient about an hour ago and that the patient seemed to be fine, and was not complaining of anything specifically. They also state that the patient has no real remarkable history aside from some high blood pressure, and perhaps some cholesterol issues; they hand you about 2-3 pill bottles reflecting this.

Once loading the patient onto your gurney, you place them in a semi-fowler position, and again note that the patient's level of consciousness has not yet improved. Initially, the patient was found in the back bedroom of an older house without central A/C.

You move your patient to the ambulance, and begin the secondary (your primary was negative for any obvious trauma consistent with a substantial fall) assessment. You reveal breath sounds to be clear, and unremarkable, the patient's blood glucose is assessed and found to be within normal limits.

You then place your patient on the cardiac monitor, and SPO2. You find them to be tachycardic in the 140's with no apparent ectopy, or indication of an arrythmia. You note that the patient has remained obtunded, and elect to place a nasopharyngeal airway to elicit a response, which it does, indicating no need for further airway protection at this point.

You note that this patient's SPO2 is adequate with 10 lpm NRB at ~95%. The one thing that sticks out most is that this patient appears extremely hot-to-the-touch even after having been removed from a humid environment
