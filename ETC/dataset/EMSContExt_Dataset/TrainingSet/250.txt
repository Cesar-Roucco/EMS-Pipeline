Was called to a report of a 34 y/o male unresponsive at home. Pulled up to a single wide mobile home in the county and had family meet us at the truck. They told us they had been trying to wake him up all day (it was about 1500hrs at time of call). Report that last night he had been taking xanax and some prescription pain pills before he went to bed and they think he over did it. They reported that he had no significant history besides a recent back surgery (3months ago) and depression. They led us to the back bedroom where we found the patient laying supine in bed with cyanotic with deep snoring respirations. VS: Sinus Tach at 120, RR10, SPO2 61%, BP 119/70, pupils where pinpoint. Skin was dry and cyanotic in his nail beds and lips. I immediately had my partner insert an OPA and start bagging with supplemental o2. I started an IV and obtained a glucose check which was 126. At this point the bvm had brought his SPO2 to 95%. Per protocol I started with 2mg of Narcan IVP. After no response to that I gave him .5mg of Romazicon. And to my suprise........NOTHING!!! I thought for sure that the problem was a xanax OD. Frustrated I inserted an ETT and he took it like a champ, no gag at all. So we ran him in and at the ER they repeated with 2mg of Narcan and .5 of Romazicon with the same response...nothing. His tox screen came back positive for opiates and benzos, but everything thing was pretty much normal besides a white count that was elevated at 18.3. He also had a negative CT. The only thing I could think of is that his family hadn't seen him awake since he went to bed the night before around midnight and that he laid in bed for the approximate 15 or so hours hypoxic the entire time and had a hypoxic brain injury?
