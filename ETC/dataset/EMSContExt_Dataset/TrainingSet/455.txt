I was called to a residence for a pt that was having a stroke. Before I got their are company EMS Director had arrived with the volunteer FD. He access the pt and called me confirming that it was a stroke, when I arrived he ( ems director ) had his bag packed and soon as me and my partner walked in the door, he left the house, before he did I asked did you get a BS on this pt he said, no but, the wife did and it was 124 and he left. So, I said to the wife so you got 124 for a BS and she said yes or it was 24 I can't remember it was couple of hours ago or at lunch time it is 18:00. PT was disoriented, sweaty, clammy, and cold to the touch. So, I took V/S which was 124/78 Resp 14, HR 78 and BS 32, so IV D50, and to the ambulance. As we are traveling down the 800 mile country road with no end, I have the pt on the monitor and doing my vital signs as the 78 y/o male is wakeing I notice couplets, then runs of VT, at which time I give him 100mg of Lidocaine 1 mg/kg which you know. It stoped it and the pt returned to sinus with occasional PVC. We have Amiodarone but I grabbed the Lidocaine since its prefilled and easy choice. I would also like to let you know that after this happened I asked the wife if he had chest pain and she said he had some this moring and around lunch time. Ok with what I told you would you have choose anything else, or any different med and how would you handeled the the EMS Director which is a Paramedic.
