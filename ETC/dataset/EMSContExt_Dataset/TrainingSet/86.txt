I must mention it was a very cold evening, let's say -30 C (-22 F).

Call came in aprox 1900, low priority for a emotionally distressed patient. Arrive on scene in a decent neighborhood and are greeted at the door by a gentleman in his 60ies. He whispers to us that his friend has been really down and he came to check up on him today and finds that he is worse than normal. He states that his friend has no energy, is always tired, and has no motivation to do anything. He will not leave the house, his friends have been helping him out because of this. He is worried about what he might do.

Initial contact: a man in his 60ies is seated on the couch. He is wearing a white tank top and a pair of slacks. He does track you as you walk in. You notice four bottles of medication on the coffee table in front of him, the house is well kept and nothing else out of the ordinary stands out. There are two other men standing in the living room who identify themselves as his friends.

Patient states his mother, whom he lived with, passed away several weeks ago and he was having a hard time dealing with her passing. He says over the last few days, he's been more tired than normal, complains of weakness, says he has difficulty walking. He says all of this with a flat affect.
