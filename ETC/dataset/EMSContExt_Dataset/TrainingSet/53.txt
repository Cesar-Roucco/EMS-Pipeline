You are called to the residence of an 18y/o male. It is a normal middle class house in a normal middle class neighborhood. You enter to find an 18y/o male sitting in a chair trying to hold himself off his left buttock and he is visibly uncomfortable. He tells you that he woke up yesterday morning with the pain. He figured it would go away but it is much worse today.
