You are called to your local health center for a BLS transfer of a 60 year old male, going for a Head CT. It's a patient you've already been acquainted with, since two days ago one of the other crews brought her to the nearby stroke facility (~75 km away) for a suspected CVA, and after being given TPA and receiving 24hrs of monitoring, you and your partner brought her back for continued care.
It's been ~48 hours since TPA was given. Thrombolytics were unsuccessful, and the patient was left with right-sided paralysis and significant aphasia (he can only say "Yes", "No", and something that sounds like "bipisa").
When the nurses came this morning to give the patient his AM meds, the patient was found to have lost the ability to swallow or chew (new finding), and seemed increasingly confused. The attending physician has now requested a repeat head CT at a center ~1.5 hours away.
When you arrive at the nurses station to receive a report, you find that all of the nurses are missing. When you look around, you discover that all of the nurses are in the room where your patient currently is. They're moving around frantically, and they've just finished administering adenosine.
The patient appears significantly distressed, is not responding to questions, and appears acutely ill. He's on a NRB at 15 lpm, has a 20g IV in his left wrist running at 75 ml/hr, and has cardiac monitoring showing a rate of ~190bpm.
