It's 1pm and you are called to a small three bedroom unit (apartment) on a divided lot in a reasonably well kept neighbourhood in a major metropolitan city. The chief complaint on the magic telly box in the big white van has been listed as "feeling unwell".

You arrive to find the house is quite messy and unkempt, very dirty with lots of dishes piled high in the kitchen and several cats running around inside. There is lots of newspaper laid down on the kitchen floor and the house reeks.

Many Middle Eastern students in their 20s exclaim "to be coming the quickly, yes please, sick, sick!" while yelling at each other in some foreign language. In the lounge there are 3 mattresses on the floor, one of which contains the patient. A total of 8 people live in the home.

The patient is a female in her early 20s, she appears very unwell.

PMHx - none; is on an international student visa for last 4 months; "never sick" in home country

HPI 10/7 feeling unwell, malaise, fever, diarrhoea, malena, nausea, vomiting, no hameotemesis, low appetite, abdo pain, low urine output

Obs BP 90/40 PR 120 RR 38 SpO2 92 (RA) T 40.1 (104 F) BGL 4 (80 mg/dl) CR 3

The other people tell you that while she has been sick they have been feeding her "the helping curry" which is basically vegetables and rice with some curry spices, and lots of water. You notice a large plastic milk container nearby filled with water, the container is very dirty.
