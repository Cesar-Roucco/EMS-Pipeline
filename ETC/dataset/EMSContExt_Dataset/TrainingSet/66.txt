You have been dispatched to a potential suicide. At the scene, law enforcement officers arrive and advise you that this is an 18-year-old male patient with a single gun shot wound (GSW) to the head. The patient is unconscious but still breathing about four times a minute. When you arrive on scene, the patient takes his last breath but continues to have a pulse.
