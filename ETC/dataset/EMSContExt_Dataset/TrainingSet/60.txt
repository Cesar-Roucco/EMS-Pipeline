You are staffing an ALS ambulance in a rural farming area. There is a local community hospital with an ED. The main medical centre is 45 minutes away.

You are dispatched for an 'unwell person'. A 31 year-old female was at a u-pick when she started to feel weak.

En route the call is upgraded to 'cardiac arrest' and the local volunteer FD has been dispatched as well.

You arrive at the farm and the FD is on scene. The MFR are doing CPR on a women in the middle of a raspberry field. It looks safe other than a few shady looking chickens roaming about.
