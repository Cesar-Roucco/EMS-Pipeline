You receive a call for a 60 yo female. The call comes in as a card Unconscious/Fainting.

You arrive on scene-scene safe/no hazards. Temp outside is -20/no snow tho. You find your patient unconscious in the passenger side of the vehicle with the pt's son (the only person who has been around pt)trying to seatbelt her in. He states the 3 mins it took you to get there was just too long and he was going to drive her to the hospital.
