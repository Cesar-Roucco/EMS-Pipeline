I was posting for a another unit that had a ldt, and was disp for a possible OD, Enroute as you all we try to asume what we a possible going to be faced with, and in this town meth is bad, and other illegal drugs. So upon arrival I was thinking that it was illegal or script OD. We found a 41 y/o male pt with a friend and she stated that he had taken 10 Lortab 10/500 with 30 Phenergan 25-50mg pills and chased them with ETOH. However, the pt was still AOX3, and said it had been 2 hours since he had taken these meds, so placed on the monitor, IV, O2 by N/C to start V/S stable, with no distress, just I getting back at my wife, so in the ambulance enroute to ER pt started to LOC, so I gave he a 1 mg of Narcan to start, and new full well what was to come, from my action and knowing that we don't have RSI, and have to have orders for intubation in this scenario, He got narcan just enough to keep him breathing, but also knowing that the phenergan is increasing the effects of the narcotic in Lortab. We as I though he woke up and proceed to kick my but while he was vomiting, what a thrill. So we get the pt to the hospital and have all his bottles, we find that he had just filled his lortab the day before and their was 180 lortab missing and with the phenergan, he also had vistaril, neurotin with the other meds so the drs figured that he had ingested the whole bottle he would have ingested 90,000 mgs of Acetamiphen, and 1800 mg of Hydrocodone with the phenergan, That has to be the most I think I have ever seen on pt take. I would like to know what you have seen and done for similar pts, and conditions.
