 I am an EMT student and 3 weeks ago in class we learned about "vital signs", learning the normal blood pressure for adults and children. I was a little concerned when my blood pressure was consistently >180/100. I recorded two weeks of morning, noon, and nite vitals and made an appointment to see my doctor. I was seen by the physicians assistant and when presented with the recorded trend she looked back through my file and commented that my blood pressure had been that high every visit since 1999, comprised of approx. 20 visits.
