You are working in a rural EMS system you are on a three man truck which is made up of two EMT-Bs and yourself (Medic, B, what have you). You are dispatched to a patient having chest pain. You arrive at the house to find a professionally cleaned house with nothing noted on the outside. Scene is to be considered safe until further notice. Two people meet you at the door stating that they are the parents of a 20 year old male patient who is inside having chest pain and shortness of breath, not acting right.
