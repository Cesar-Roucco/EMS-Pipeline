Dispatched for an assault victim, alcohol involved PD is to be en route. You arrive on scene once assured that the scene is safe. PD has a 39 y/o female. Apparent intoxication, however no apparent injuries. You start your assessment, and upon assessment you find that pt is complaining of neck and back pain and wishes to be transported to the local hospital. Shortly after pt tells you this, she changes her mind, says she does not want to go to the hospital. PD advises her that she can either go to the hospital or jail. Pt states she would rather go to jail then to the hospital. PD takes her into custody and requests a refusal form be filled out for legality. You fill the refusal form out but you are unable to contact command due to being in the mountains with no service. PD requests that you stay on scene because they are searching for the assaulter. You stay on scene and hang out with PD. Well the pt decides she no longer wants to go to jail she would rather go to the hospital first. Redo assessment, upon assessment pt states "I don't hurt anywhere, don't touch me just leave me the f**k alone while we go to the hospital." Pd rides along. The entire way pt tells you she is uninjured, and wants no treatment.
