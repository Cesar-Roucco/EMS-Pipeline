You are working as a paramedic alongside an EMT in a small city approximately 20 minutes away from a larger metropolitan area when you are called to respond to a patient complaining of abdominal pain.

The address is right around the block so you go non-emergency traffic and arrive first on scene, though you know BLS fire will be arriving shortly. You are guided into the upper-middle class home by the husband who leads you to a bedroom where you find a forty year old female patient laying completely still in bed alert and oriented x3 though very soft-spoken and appearing to be in a significant amount of pain, based on her facial grimace and unwillingness to move. You also note that the patient is guarding her abdomen with both hands.
