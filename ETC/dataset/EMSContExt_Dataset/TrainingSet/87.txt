You are dispatched to the local state run nursing home at midnight. Dispatch states that they have a 94 year old female stroke victim that needs to be transported to the ER. They are requesting no fire response, and no lights or sirens from the ambulance.

You arrive on scene emergent, though quietly, (Cause you don't really like the nursing home telling you how to respond), are escorted to a room far in the back of the facility. While the nurse escorts you back she explains that the patien has sever right sided facial droop and slurred speech, that she fell out of bed while trying to go to the restroom causing the discovery of these issues. She did no further neurologic testing. Patient is on no significant medications and has no significant medical history other than walking the planet for the last 96 years.

There you find what appears to be a very dignified looking elderly lady sitting up in her bed looking like she was recentely awakened...
