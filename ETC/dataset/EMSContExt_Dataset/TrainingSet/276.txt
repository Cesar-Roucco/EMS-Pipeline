On a four lane street a driver slowed and motioned for an elderly pedestrian to go ahead. The lady did, but when she go into the other lane of traffic she was hit. The woman that motioned her to go was the typical hysterical person, who wouldn't be. I wasn't at the scene but was in the ER when both ladies were brought in. This lady was literally tearing her clothes off. We put her in a room way down the hall from the cardiac room where they were treating the woman who was hit. One of the guys I worked with and I tended to her. Two nurses, a social worker, and even a Nun came in to help her. They gave her valium and I believe Versaid. It was a good hour before she calmed down enough to talk. Her husband came in and she started to panic again while trying to explain to him what happened. But he got her talked down quickly.
