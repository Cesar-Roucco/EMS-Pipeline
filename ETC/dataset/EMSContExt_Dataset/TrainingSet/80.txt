You are called to the scene of a 30 year old male that was working at a height of approximately 40 feet when his scaffolding collapsed. For about the first 10 minutes he was laughing and joking with his buddies about how cool it was to get paid to sit in a swing and look at the jungle, but about 3 minutes ago he stopped talking and seems to be sleeping.

The rescue team was quickly on scene, within 5 minutes, but didn't see any reason to call EMS as the patient hadn't suffered any trauma. When you arrive they have lowered him nearly to the ground, he is still in his harness in a sitting position, probably about 30 seconds from touching the ground where the rescue team has set up a collar and long board in preparation.
