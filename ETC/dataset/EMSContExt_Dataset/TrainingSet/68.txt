You and your partner are returning a patient from the Emergency Department to the local nursing home in an ambulance. Your partner is attending to the patient, and you are driving. You put the radio on your favorite music station and crack the windows to let the crisp winter air in. While you are waiting at a stoplight, a small pickup truck blasts through the red light and hits a man riding a moped, knocking him 10 feet into the air and slamming him on the asphalt. Initially, you are so shocked that you can't remember what the name of the road is. You finally compose yourself enough to call in the accident.
