Hi Doc this is Alex Kroeze, ACP, OASIS #15411.

I'm calling for a field pronouncement here Doc. I'm in the back yard of a residence with a mid-30s female patient who was found floating face down in the pool, unknown how long she was there. On arrival of the PCP crew the patient was VSA. They performed upfront CPR and then upon analyze discovered Asystole. We arrived as ACP backup just as they were doing their 3rd analyze and patient was still asystole. After one round of epi patient had fine v-fib which was shocked into a bradycardic PEA. Atropine and a 250cc bolus were given and patient was found to be back into v-fib. She has had 2 more epi and 2 lidocaine since then and remains in fine v-fib unresponsive to shocks. Patient is intubated with good air entry however ETCO2 is reading in the middle range on the disposable detector. At this point I'd like to cease resuscitation Doc unless you feel that a trial of bicarb is warranted.
