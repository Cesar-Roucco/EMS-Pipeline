Dispatched as a first responder to a 26 y/o w Female , Boyfriend says she overdosed on some pills, you don't know the exact pill at this moment. When you get to the scene the patient is sitting upright in a chair on the front porch. When you start asking her questions she seems alert x3. Answering all questions total alert. Says she don't need hospital.. but you take her vitals anyways. She seems fine when she goes unresponsive and weary, you do a sternum rub and she responds to pain.. you grab the cot and load her up where paramedics start IV's.. She goes totaly under.. but still responds to pain.. She comes together when you say you need to start to tube her..
