You are dispatched to a rough looking hood at 9pm for an unconscious called in by 5 year old who said he fell asleep watching TV and awoke to find his sister had done fallen down while mom and dad are out to dinner.

Having secured the ambulance with the trusty steering lock, you arrive on the second floor of the walk up to find two kids (one aged 5 and one aged 3) peaking out and crying over thier sister who is unconscious and cyanotic.
