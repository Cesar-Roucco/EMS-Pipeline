Get a call for a man who is found on a cinder block. If you all know what a cinder block is - it's the 2 foot by 1 foot block of concrete with two square holes in it. It looks like a domino but made of concrete.

Wife just walked out from the house to the backyard after not hearing from him for about 30 mins.

He has no pulse and is not breathing.
