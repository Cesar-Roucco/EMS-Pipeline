You are dispatched for an unconscious female with the local fire department and arrive on scene as the same time as an engine company with 3 FF/EMT's. The house is generally rundown and unkempt with no apparent danger. You are met by an unhurried adult male who tell's you that "my girl isn't feeling good and I can't wake her up." He leads you down a long narrow hall filled with junk to a back bedroom. Upon entering you see a adult (early 50's by appearance) female laying in bed not moving.
