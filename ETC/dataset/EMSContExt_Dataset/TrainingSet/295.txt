You get toned out at 04:30 for a single car MVA. On arrival you find a twentyish looking male fighting with PD struggling to get out of a car. You find the car in the middle of a field having gone through some fencing and down a hill. PD states they found the guy unconscious initially, but woke up a bit later and started trying to get out of the car - lower extremities are pinned requiring extrication so he's not going anywhere. Windshield has starring, positive airbag deployment. Pt unable to tell you anything, doesn't seem to comprehend what is going on. No witnesses to the accident, guy just drove up on it and called cops. You have unlimited protocols, tell me what you want to do. Assessments and all - how would you transport? You are 45 from local hospital (community) and an hour and a half from trauma center.
