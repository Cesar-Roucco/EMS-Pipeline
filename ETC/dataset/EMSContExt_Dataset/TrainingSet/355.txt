You are called to the local elementary school for a 9 year old female who has been vomiting. The school nurse tells you they have been having a rash of kids with the stomach flu who have presented with vomiting and diarrhea. This particular girl looked more dehydrated than the others have and she was unable to get in touch with the kids parents so she decided to call and get her a ride to the ER.
