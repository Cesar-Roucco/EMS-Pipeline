You arrive on scene to find an elderly gentleman sitting in his recliner. He is obviously disturbed that you are here. He says that his wife called you after he told her not to. When you talk with the gentleman, you find that he is having a significant amount of chest pain that radiates down his left arm and into his jaw. He says that he is tired of hospitals and does not want you to do anything for him. He tells you that he has a long history of heart problems and was recently told he needed a heart transplant. You try to convince the man to let you transport him to the hospital for treatment, but he continues to refuse care. You ask him and his wife if he has some form of advanced directive there at home, and they tell you that "the doctor is working on it but has not sent it home yet."
