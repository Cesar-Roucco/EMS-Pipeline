You respond 30 miles outside of your base for a man entrapped in a piece of farm equipment

Weather is crappy and there are severe thunderstorms all around your area and no helicopter pilot in his right mind would attempt a flight in that weather.

Your hospital is a 76 bed facility with a 10 bed ER. No orthopedic surgeon nor trauma surgeon is available today.
