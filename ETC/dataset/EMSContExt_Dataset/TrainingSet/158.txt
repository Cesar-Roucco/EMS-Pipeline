You are working with your paramedic partner in a small town just outside the big city of the county you work in when you are dispatched to a moped accident. It is around 2300, and you respond lights and sirens to the intersection of a street with no traffic on it where you find the driver of a moped lying supine in the street. The moped is about twenty feet away with no major damage, however from the truck you can see that the patient's face is covered in blood. You are first on scene but can already see the BLS fire units' lights in the distance.
