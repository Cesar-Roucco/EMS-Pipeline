Called to the scene of a man who says he's depressed and just wants transport to the ED For evaluation of depression.

On arrival you beat the Police and being the Stud that you and your partner are, you enter the house with simply the med bag and nothing else.

You call out and a voice beckons you back to the back bedroom.

You walk back to the bedroom and find it empty. You turn around and find a middle aged man, wide eyed and deranged look with what appears to be a .357 magnum handgun in his left hand. He says "Aint none of us getting out of here today"

You(studly medic) and your partner(super studly medic) look at each other. You are able to slowly reach down and press your radio's emergency alert button before the guy realizes what you did and makes you take everything off except for your fabric uinform. Everything but your shirt, pants, and shoes. He proceeds to throw out the front door everything you brought in with you which of course lands in the front yard as the first responding police units arrive. He proceeds to yell "Don't you fucking cops come in here or the ambulance drivers are dead, you hear me?"
