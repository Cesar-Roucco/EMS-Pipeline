Upon arrival, you find the home to be in quite a disarray and the lady says she has difficulty getting around due to arthritis which has been worse the last week particularly in her right leg. She is speaking to you in full sentences, but frequently moaning and complaining about her chest and her head which she states is a crushing quality 8 out of 10 intensity. You do your assessment and find vitals to be as follows : BP 140/94, Pulse 110, Resp 24 even unlabored, SpO2 98% room air. You try to get her up out of her recliner which she states she has been in almost all the time with legs elevated for last two days and she nearly collapses on you due to weakness in her legs. She states reason she called tonight rather than going to the doctor was the chest pain which she thought heart burn and has been treating with tums the last three days increased dramatically and her intense headache. She tells you her medical hx was a brain tumor removed 10 years ago, diabetes, and pulmonary embolisms x 2 about 8 years ago. She hands you a walmart bag full of meds, some of which she is actively on, others she is not.
