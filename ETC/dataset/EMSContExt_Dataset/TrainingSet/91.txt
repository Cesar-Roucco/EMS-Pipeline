You are dispatched to a suburban home for a 'sick person'.

On arrivial you are greeted by the patient's son. He says his mother is acting funny and hasn't been well for the last week or so. He ushers you into the kitchen.

The patient is sitting at the table looking pale, weak and is having trouble sitting up in the chair. He breathing is laboured. Two of her grandchildren are supporting her. Thier is panic in the air.
