You are called to the house of a 43 y/o female who has been seizing for the last 10 minutes. The son is running around the house like he is looking for something but can't find it. The daughter is at the pts side, crying, saying, "Mommy don't die!!" The husband is leaning over the pt saying, "Damn, I never seen anything like this before. Can you guys do something to make her stop?"
