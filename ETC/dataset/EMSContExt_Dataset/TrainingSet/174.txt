60 year old female calls for SOB. She says she ate some candy then became SOB (did not choke). shortly after that, she develops CP. vitals are all stable...no significant increase in work of breathing, lungs clear......EKG has a sinus rhythm with occassional unifocal PVC's. begin treating the pt for CP and dyspnea. on the way to the hospital the 12 lead EKG is being monitored. you see that the pt is now having some multifocal PVC's though rare. now 10 minutes prior to reaching the er the pt is now showing periods of trigeminy PVC's on the monitor. there is no change in the pt's presentation or complaints.
