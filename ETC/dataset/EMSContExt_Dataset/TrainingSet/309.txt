This was a scenario that we had in class. You are called out for a 17 year old male patient found unresponsive in his front yard by his neighbors. You arrive on scene and find it to be secure. After taking proper BSI precautions you approach and find him to be completely unresponsive. While your partner begins the assessment you ask the neighbors if they know anything about him. They answer no. You find a ladder nearby. He looks like he has been working on the ladder. Take it from here.
