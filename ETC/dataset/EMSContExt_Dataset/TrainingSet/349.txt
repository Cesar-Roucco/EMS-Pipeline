You just finished a run and are driving (your ambulance) back to the station at 1AM. You see a 1980's model smaller-sized pickup truck that has obviously collided with a telephone. It is partially up on the sidewalk and the front end isn't quite wrapped around the pole, but there's significant intrusion into the hood area by the pole. You're in a suburban environment.
