You look at your watch and it is 23:50 hrs. You just finished stocking your ambulance when tones drop. You are dispatched to a “possible heart attack” at 555 Chest pain drive. Your crew consists of: you as the proctoring medic, your partner Joe an AEMT, and an EMT-B that you can’t remember his name. He has just wandered around the Ambulance like he was lost since he arrived anyway, despite your efforts to get him involved in checking equipment and stocking the rig.

Ladder 51 is also dispatched with one Lieutenant and three FF/EMT-Bs. A private company from across town is in route as well but will arrive approximately 4 minutes after your estimated time of arrival.

You turn onto chest pain drive and into what you know to be a predominately white, working middle to low income neighborhood. It is quiet tonight. There are no people out.

You arrive at a small frame house sitting on a double lot. Other than the hedges needing to be trimmed the yard is neat and recently mowed. There is an American flag hanging from the eve of the house on a short flagpole and a truck with a lift in the driveway. The truck has a “Semper Fi” sticker in the window and a “You voted for Obama? Thanks a lot A** Ho*e bumper sticker. There is a handicapped indicator hanging from the rear view mirror as well as on the license plate.
