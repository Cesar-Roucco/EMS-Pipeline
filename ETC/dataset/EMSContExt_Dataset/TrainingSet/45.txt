You are called to the house of a 39y/o male at 4am for dental pain. He tells you that is left upper wisdom tooth has been bothering him for 3 days. It woke him up this morning and while he was using some mouthwash he developed a severe headache which is why he called you. As you walk in the room he has one episode of vomiting.
