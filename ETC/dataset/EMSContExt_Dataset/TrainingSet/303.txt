Called to a ceremony where several young girls were receiving awards. While standing in line in a very fancy dress, 17 yr. old girl passes out. On arrival the girl was conscious but seemed confused, head resting in mom's lap. She could not recall the event. Skin warm, slightly diaphoretic. Resp. 20, Pulse 60 reg., BP 110/60. Unable to put on monitor due to dress and by-standers. Have to wait until inside ambulance. Placed on 4L O2 per NC. Chief complaint of feeling weak and "woozie". No pain. No ETOH. BG 115 (If I remember right). No Hx. of medical problems. Slight built but athletic. Asked about possible pregnancy, she's starts sobbing.
