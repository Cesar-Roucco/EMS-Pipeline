You are called to perform an interfacility transport of a 38 year old male who was involved in an up an over motorcycle accident. He sustained bilateral femur fractures and a hepatic laceration. Haemostasis was accomplished following the injury and the femur fractures were stabilised about 24 hours later. The patient developed poor lung compliance following the second surgery and abdominal compartment syndrome was identified after a foley transducer was placed. The patient has just returned from a decompressive laparotomy. The facility is a level two trauma centre and the patient is being transferred to a level one about 25 minutes by ground.
