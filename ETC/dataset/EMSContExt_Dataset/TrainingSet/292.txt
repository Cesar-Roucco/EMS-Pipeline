You are dispatched to pick up a 33 year old female with chief complaint of isolated fracture to the humerus. Enroute, she begins to complain of pain again (you are on a transfer). You consult with med control and they order 2 mg morphine. You draw it up to administer and push it. About 5 minutes later pt's pain has gone from a 8 to a 3 out of 10. Upon cleaning up the truck after the run, your basic partner finds the vial you used and it's marked diazepam (valium). Instead of giving 2 mg morphine you have given 2 mg valium. Your patient has suffered no ill effects to your knowledge, however it is still early. They did however report decreased pain which is what you were trying to achieve.
