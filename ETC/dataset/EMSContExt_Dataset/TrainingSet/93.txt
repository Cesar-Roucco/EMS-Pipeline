Scenario, you run in (I just did last night...): 31 y/o male wanted to lift his 2 y/o son and hurt his own back. Half sitting/half lying on the couch. Apparently orientated, but speaks only a foreign language noone of the team is able to understand much, so verbal assessment is a bit tricky. We narrowed it down to: severe back pain, probable herniated vertebral disk, unable to move due to pain, dumb feeling in the legs.

Problem: he's the only adult, father of a 5 month old son and his 2 y/o, caring for them when the mother works night shift in a factory. Mother was reached by phone and could quit work, but needs at least one hour to come home with public transport. The family recently arrived here, speaking only very broken german, knows noone in the neighbourhood, no relatives available. Noone to care for the kids until mummy is home!

Treatment of the patient was straight forward: monitoring (SpO2, ECG), i.v., analgesic drugs (Ketamine/Midazolam), O2, transport on vacuum matress to hospital with neurological/chirurgical capabilities (20 minutes away).
